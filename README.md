# Week-One-Refactor

## Description

Inside the repo link you will find the refactored HTML & CSS files that I have worked on. I have consolidated the HTML to include a Semantic HTML model. The link to the website is https://iamdanjoyce.github.io/week-one-refactor/

I have increased the size of the text and images to help with users with accessibility challenges. I also add descriptions to images to help identify in the code.

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.
